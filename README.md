# Taxonomy Filter Plugin

The **Taxonomy Filter** Plugin is an extension for [Grav CMS](http://github.com/getgrav/grav). q

## Installation

Since this plugin is **NOT** released to Grav's plugin directory, the plugin can only be installed manually.

> NOTE: This plugin is a modular component for Grav and requires plugin 'TaxonomyList' to be installed.

### Manual Installation

This plugin can be installed in two ways: Download a zip file, or cloning the repository.

#### Download zip
To install the plugin using zip, download the zip-version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/plugins`. Then rename the folder to `taxonomy-filter`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/tonhaarmans/taxonomy-filter).

You should now have all the plugin files under

    /your/site/grav/user/plugins/taxonomy-filter
	
#### Git clone
To install the plugin using `git clone` run the following commands in the terminal:
```
$ cd /your/site/grav/user/plugins
$ mkdir taxonomy-filter
$ cd taxonomy-filter
$ git clone https://github.com/tonhaarmans/taxonomy-filter
```

### Admin Plugin

If you use the Admin Plugin, you can install the plugin directly by opening the `Tools`-menu and clicking the `Direct install` tab. Select the downloaed zip-file and install.

## Configuration

Before configuring this plugin, you should copy the `user/plugins/taxonomy-filter/taxonomy-filter.yaml` to `user/config/plugins/taxonomy-filter.yaml` and only edit that copy.

Here is the default configuration and an explanation of available options:

```yaml
enabled: true                # Enable/disable plugin
routes: [/]                  # array of routes on which the plugin should be enabled
taxonomies: [category, tag]  # Array of taxonomies to display in list. These taxonomies must be listed in `site.yaml`.
isProduction: true           # Load minified css/js when true.
```

Note that if you use the Admin Plugin, a file with your configuration named taxonomy-filter.yaml will be saved in the `user/config/plugins/`-folder once the configuration is saved in the Admin.

## Usage

The plugin provides a Twig template that you need to include in one of your theme templates. If available choose `user/themes/<your theme>/templates/partials/sidebar.html.twig`. Depending on the layout of the 'sidebar' template, add something like:

```
{% if config.plugins['taxonomy-filter'].enabled %}
<div class="sidebar-content">
    {% include 'partials/taxonomy-filter.html.twig' ignore missing %}
</div>
{% endif %}
```
